JavaScript Runtime Environment
It is like a big container which has all the required components to run JavaScript. 

-> JS engine 
-> web API
-> Callback queue
-> Microtask queue

Every browser has a javascript run time environment.


JS engine architecture

Code ---> Parsing ----> Compilation ---> Execution

Parsing-

Code is parsed that is a "token" is generated for each line of code. Syntax parser takes the code and converts it into ==AST (Abstract syntax tree)==.


Compilation-

Initially, JS was an interpreted language but now they also use compiler depends on JS engine. Therefore, JS is called ==Just In Time Compiled language==.

Interpreter-> executes the code line by line
Compiler-> It compiles the code and optimizes it


AST ---->Interpreter <---> Compiler---> execution + (Memory Heap + Call Stack)

While the code is being interpreted line by line compiler simultaneously optimizes the code.
