Javascript is a dynamic, weakly typed programming language which is compiled at run time. It can be executed as part of a webpage in a browser or directly on any machine(host environment).

Js was created to make webpages more dynamic. 

It is interpreted language.

How is JavaScript executed?

code--------> JavaScript Engine (V8 in chrome)-----> effect on web page


javascript engine->
    - Parse code 
    - Compile to machine language
    - execute machine code 
-> It happens on a single thread 

dynamic -> Not precompiled instead parsed and compiled on the fly. Code is evaluted and executed at run time. 

weakly typed -> data types are assumed automatically. we dont define data types.

Javascript runs on a host environment. e.g- browser-side, server-side.  

JS is a ==loosely typed language==. That is, it doesn't attach its variables to any specific datatype. One variable can hold all different types of values.
